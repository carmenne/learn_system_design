#### Ajax Long-Polling
- The client opens a connection and requests data from the server using regular HTTP.
- The requested webpage sends requests to the server at regular intervals (e.g., 0.5 seconds).
- The server calculates the response and sends it back, just like regular HTTP traffic.
- The client repeats the above three steps periodically to get updates from the server.
